Introduction
This project investigates the link between diet patterns and COVID-19 outcomes on a global scale. By analyzing international data on food supplies, obesity/hunger levels, and COVID-19 cases/deaths per country, the goal is to identify correlations that can inform dietary recommendations for building immunity and resilience against future pandemics. The study aims to guide research on lifestyle risk factors for infectious diseases, offering valuable insights into the role of healthy diets in combating diseases like COVID-19 with less severity.

Problem Statement
Our project investigates the impact of diets in 170 countries on COVID-19 recovery, analyzing data from 2020 to confirm associations between specific food groups and positive or negative outcomes.
We will employ descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze the data, focusing on key nutritional factors with the aim of recommending a healthy diet for COVID-19 prevention and recovery. However, challenges such as confounding variables (external factors), ethical concerns, and the dynamic nature of the virus complicate our research efforts.
The complex nature of the issue, influenced by genetics, vaccination, hygiene, and healthcare access, makes it challenging to establish direct links between diet and outcomes. Legal and regulatory issues, evolving scientific understanding, and ethical concerns further complicate the research. Results may also be affected by socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, and vaccination status.
In summary, while we aim to find the healthiest diet for COVID-19, the multifaceted nature of the problem and various limitations, including ethical and practical challenges, need careful consideration in drawing conclusions.
  
Project Goals
The project aims to explore how different diets around the world impact people's immunity to COVID-19. By analyzing the eating habits of 170 countries, we want to establish a connection between food choices and COVID-19 impacts.
Our research hypothesis suggests that the amount of animal products, meat, cereals, vegetables, and sugar consumed might be linked to the frequency and severity of COVID-19 cases. Conversely, the null hypothesis states that there's no meaningful correlation between these food groups and COVID-19.
In the first two weeks, we'll filter and classify the data, followed by data processing. The next two weeks involve using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques like scatter plots and line charts to gain insights into dietary patterns. Moving to weeks five and six, we'll conduct regression, ANOVA, and hypothesis testing to determine if our hypothesis holds true. This rigorous statistical analysis will help identify a suitable diet for building immunity against COVID-19.
The overall goal is to contribute valuable information to nutritional departments worldwide. If successful, this project could guide dietary guidelines and public health policies to better prepare communities against future pandemics. The entire project will take two months, with progress updates every two weeks.
